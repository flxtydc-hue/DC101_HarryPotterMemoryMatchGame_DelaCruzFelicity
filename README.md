Harry Potter Memory Match Game
------------------------------
A magical, interactive memory-matching game built using vanilla web technologies. Test your concentration by matching pairs of iconic characters before the timer runs out!

⚡ Project Description
-----------------------
This project is a dynamic, browser-based game where players enter their names and race against a 60-second clock. The game features a "Spellbook" mechanic that allows players to use limited magical abilities to assist them, and it includes a "Dementor Attack" visual event when the timer reaches a critical level.

Technologies Used
------------------
-HTML5

-CSS3

-JavaScript (Vanilla ES6)

Launching the Game
--------------------
   1. Download all project files into a single folder.
   
   2. Open the folder and locate the index.html file.
   
   3. Run:
   
      Simple: Double-click index.html to open it in your default browser.
      
      Recommended: If using VS Code, right-click index.html and select "Open with Live Server". This ensures the localStorage and background music load correctly without browser security restrictions.
   

How to Play
------------------
   1. Enter your name in the start menu and click "Mischief Managed!"
   
   2. Click on any card to flip it; find the matching character to clear them from the board.
   
   3. Use your Spellbook button if you are running out of time—but use them wisely, as you only get one charge per spell.
   
   4. Beat the 60-second timer to see your name on the Top 5 Leaderboard!
